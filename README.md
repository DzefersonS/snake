# snake

Snake game made in C.  
Features:  

- All traditional rules of snake fully implemented  
- Collision with walls, tail and food
- Measures score  


Flaws:

- Bad board outputting method (making, in essence, a pagebreak in console, then reprinting after a delay)
- Board breaks when using smaller board size, same with too big of a board size (game was made with a 24x24 board in mind)
- Undocumented & Messy code
